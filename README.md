# Project Title: IoT based Smart Door Lock Security System with NodeMCU ESP8266 and Blynk App

# Repository Description:
Welcome to the Smart Door Lock Security System project repository! This open-source project focuses on enhancing traditional door locking systems using the power of IoT (Internet of Things) technology. By combining the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller with the Blynk app platform, we have created a robust and user-friendly solution that provides advanced security features for your doors.

# Project Highlights:
- **Enhanced Security:** Our Smart Door Lock Security System offers a higher level of security compared to conventional locks. With real-time monitoring, remote access, and customizable alerts, you can have peace of mind knowing your property is well protected.
- **Blynk App Integration:** The Blynk app serves as the control center for your smart door lock. Through an intuitive mobile interface, you can lock and unlock your door remotely, monitor its status, and receive instant notifications on any unauthorized activities.
-  **IoT Connectivity:** Leveraging the power of the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller, our system connects your door lock to the internet, enabling seamless communication between your smartphone and the lock. This connectivity also paves the way for future integrations and updates.
-  **Open-Source Advantage:** This repository is open-source, encouraging collaboration and innovation in the field of smart security systems. Developers and enthusiasts can contribute, customize, and enhance the project to suit their unique needs.

# Key Features:
- **Remote Locking and Unlocking:** Control your door lock remotely from anywhere (WiFi accessible area) using the Blynk app.
- **Real-time Notifications:** The system sends real-time notifications to the Blynk app whenever the door is locked, unlocked, or when an unauthorized attempt is detected.
- **Customizable Alerts:** Configure alerts to notify you of specific events, such as failed unlock attempts or unexpected door openings.
- **Secure Authentication:** Implement secure authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can control the door lock.
- **Low Power Consumption:** The NodeMCU ESP8266 is designed for efficiency, ensuring optimal performance while minimizing energy usage.
